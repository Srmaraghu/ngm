# Nepal Government Modernization (NGM)

**Judicial Data Scrapers for Nepal's Court System**

## Overview

Nepal Government Modernization (NGM) is a specialized data collection service that systematically scrapes and structures judicial data from Nepal's court system. The service collects case information, hearing records, and legal proceedings from all levels of Nepal's judiciary, making this public information accessible in a structured, queryable format.

## What NGM Does

NGM automates the collection of judicial data from Nepal's court websites, transforming unstructured web pages into a comprehensive database of court cases and proceedings. This enables:

- **Transparency**: Making court proceedings accessible to citizens, researchers, and journalists
- **Accountability**: Tracking case progression and judicial decisions over time
- **Research**: Enabling data-driven analysis of Nepal's judicial system
- **Integration**: Providing structured data for other services in the Jawafdehi ecosystem
